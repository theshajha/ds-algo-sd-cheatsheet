## Why donâ€™t engineering interviews ever stop talking about sorting?
1. Computers spend more time sorting than anything else, historically 25% on mainframes.
2. Sorting is the best studied problem in computer science, with a variety of different algorithms known.
3. Most of the interesting ideas we will encounter can be taught in the context of sorting, such as divide-and-conquer, randomized algorithms, and lower bounds.
