# System Design in a Hurry
A no-nonsense guide covering all the essentials needed to pass a system design interview. It's based on data from hundreds of interviews and was written by FAANG engineers and hiring managers.

## Things to consider

## What interviewers are looking for in your system design
- Scalability
- Availability
- Cost-efficiency
- Latency
- Security

### Based on the role
- While all candidates are expected to complete a full design satisfying the requirements, a mid-level engineer might only do this with 80% breadth and 20% depth, while a senior engineer might do this with 60% breadth and 40% depth.
- A mid-level engineer might be asked to design a system that can handle 1000 requests per second, while a senior engineer might be asked to design a system that can handle 100,000 requests per second.
- Senior engineers are expected to use more advanced techniques such as sharding, caching, and load balancing while mid-level engineers are expected to use more basic techniques such as horizontal scaling and vertical scaling.
- Senior engineers are expected to convincingly defend their design choices, trade-offs, and constraints, while mid-level engineers are expected to explain their design choices and trade-offs.

## Examples to Practice
### Product-based (Most common)
- Design a URL shortening service like TinyURL
- Design a social media feed like Twitter
- Design a notification system like Slack
- Design a recommendation system like Netflix
- Design a search engine like Google
- Design a caching system like Redis
- Design a rate limiter like Stripe
- Design a distributed system like AWS
- Design a system to process events in real-time
- Design a system to process payments
- Design a system to process user data

### Infrastructure-based (Less common but still important)
- Design a rate limiter
- Design a message broker
- Design a key-value store
- Design a distributed database
- Design a distributed file system
- Design a distributed cache
- Design a distributed logging system
- Design a distributed monitoring system
- Design a distributed tracing system

## Object Oriented Design (Less common)
- Design a parking lot reservation system
- Design a vending machine
- Design an elevator control system
