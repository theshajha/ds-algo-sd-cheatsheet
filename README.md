# 60-Minute Technical Interview Prep Guide

A curated collection of Data Structures, Algorithms, and System Design concepts for quick interview preparation.

## Who Is This For?
- Software engineers with 2+ years of experience needing a quick refresh
- Engineers familiar with core CS concepts but need structured revision
- Candidates preparing for technical interviews with limited time

## Who Is This NOT For?
- Complete beginners to programming or CS concepts
- Those looking for in-depth theoretical explanations
- Students preparing for academic examinations

## ⚠️ Important Cautions
- This is a refresh guide, not a comprehensive learning resource
- Concepts are simplified for quick revision
- Practice with real problems is still essential
- Use this alongside system design practice and mock interviews
